## problem?

The [`immutable` compiler option](https://svelte.dev/docs#compile-time-svelte-compile),
which is `false` by default in Svelte and SvelteKit,
can sometimes improve performance as demonstrated in
[the official example](https://svelte.dev/examples/immutable-data).

You can enable it app-wide in SvelteKit with
[the config's `compilerOptions`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#configuration)
or locally per component
[with `<svelte:options>`](https://svelte.dev/docs#template-syntax-svelte-options).

Better performance you say? Sounds great, right?
Unfortunately immutability is incompatible with some common patterns.

Many Svelte developers prefer to write code that mutates objects,
and the language makes this very terse, like binding to store properties.
(e.g. `<input bind:value={$store.text} />`)
Let's consider this class of problem solvable; developers who choose immutability
will need to avoid certain kinds of mutation. That's just part of the deal.

However, immutability also causes problems in two cases that motivated this library:

- putting a
  [`WeakMap`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap)
  in a reactive store
- large arrays, maps, and other collections that are too expensive to copy,
  where mutation is acceptable if we can get store reactivity to work

We could use a library with efficient immutable data structures,
but then we're no longer using plain JS values
and our related code and familiar patterns may be incompatible.
Libraries like [Immutable.js](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js/)
have APIs that diverge from plain JS data structures,
and they're not light dependencies. (version 4 is 65k minified)
Libraries like [immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer)
make our normal JS code _mostly_ compatible, but they're inefficient for large collections;
we want to avoid copying large data structures.

And furthermore, libraries like `Immutable.js` and `immer` do not work with with `WeakMap`s,
so neither is a complete solution.

We could try to enable `immutable` globally and opt out on a per-component basis, or vice versa,
but this is error prone and adds a lot of mental overhead,
and it loses the efficiency of the `immutable` option for the rest of the component.

Is there a sweet spot for this use case? Can we enable the immutable option globally
while treating large collections as reactive mutable values?

## solution?

This project demonstrates two custom stores to help solve this problem:
[`mutable`](/src/lib/mutable.ts) and
[`fastMutable`](src/lib/fastMutable.ts).
The solutions are a WIP and I could use some help and feedback.
There are additional notes and questions below.

The code is deployed to
[spiderspace.github.io/mutable](https://spiderspace.github.io/mutable)
and there's also
[this REPL demonstration](https://svelte.dev/repl/0d7852935b2247a89cb04255f374a309?version=3.46.1).

- usecases:
  - large maps and arrays of stores (client-side indexes of reactive backend state)
- implementations
  - `mutable`, that wraps every store change in a new object reference as a `value` property
  - `fastMutable` that tries to be efficient (maybe too clever)
- questions
  - is `fastMutable` a footgun?
  - names?
  - `set` method? (maybe for `bind:` patterns?) guidance against using it?
- want to help?
  - spiderspace discussions post (TODO make this post and link it)

  - [Twitter poll](https://twitter.com/ryanatkn/status/1482390036943360010)
    asking users if they use `immutable`

## more notes and questions

- Why care about the immutable option? Mainly performance.
  See [the official example](https://svelte.dev/examples/immutable-data).
- The usecases motivating these stores: large maps and other collections (often containing
  stores) for complex client-side indexing.
- Can we solve this problem with a better pattern than these custom stores? Am I missing
  something? Maybe lightweight immutable maps/arrays/sets with structural sharing and an API
  that jive with their JS counterparts? [Immutable.js](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js)
  version 4 is 65k minified and has patterns that diverge from the builtin collections
  (which in some cases might be worth paying for),
  and it doesn't solve the `WeakMap` usecase.
- Is `fastMutable`'s strategy of swapping between two stable references a dangerous
  footgun? It doesn't compose with code that expects every change to be referentially unique.
  Should the `mutable` implementation be preferred in all cases?
- Are there better names than `mutable` and `fastMutable`?

## more info

This is both a niche and advanced topic,
particularly because Svelte defaults to `immutable: false`.
Many developers don't know or care about it,
and the usecase motivating these stores is niche.
(large data collections that cause performance problems when cloned)

### how to enable `immutable`?

Two ways:

1. globally: set `immutable: true` in the
   [SvelteKit config](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#configuration).
   See this project's [`svelte.config.js`](/svelte.config.js) for an example.
2. locally per component:
   [`<svelte:options immutable={true}>`](https://svelte.dev/docs#template-syntax-svelte-options)

### how does `immutable` work?

The option tells the Svelte compiler to
[swap this function](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/a4e4027f794dad93bcd6ffd74c1a19a9ce9ef6ac/src/compiler/compile/render_dom/index.ts#L122):

[src/runtime/internal/utils.ts](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/a4e4027f794dad93bcd6ffd74c1a19a9ce9ef6ac/src/runtime/internal/utils.ts#L39)

```js
export function safe_not_equal(a, b) {
	return a != a ? b == b : a !== b || (a && typeof a === 'object') || typeof a === 'function';
}
```

for this one:

[src/runtime/internal/utils.ts](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/a4e4027f794dad93bcd6ffd74c1a19a9ce9ef6ac/src/runtime/internal/utils.ts#L53)

```js
export function not_equal(a, b) {
	return a != a ? b == b : a !== b;
}
```
